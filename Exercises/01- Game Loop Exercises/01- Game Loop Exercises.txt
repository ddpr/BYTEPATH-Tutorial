    Q: What is the role that Vsync plays in the game loop? 
        It is enabled by default and you can disable it by calling love.window.setMode with the vsync attribute set to false.
    A: 
        -Vsync (short for vertical synchronization) synchronizes the frame rate of your graphics card with your monitors refresh rate.
            This is done to prevent screen tearing in graphic-itensive applications.
        - I disabled vsynch by adding the line: love.window.setMode(800,600,{vsync=false}) to love.load() where the arguements are 
            (width,height,{flags}).

    Q: Implement the Fixed Delta Time loop from the Fix Your Timestep article by changing love.run.

    A: Implementing a Fixed Delta Time loop would involve removing the default delta time loop from love.run() and adding 
            a variable with a fixed delta time value. In this case, we use: 
                local dt = 1/60. This is so that when love.update(dt) is called, it updates at a fixed rate.

    Q: Implement the Variable Delta Time loop from the Fix Your Timestep article by changing love.run.

    A: The default game loop happens to already incorporate a variable delta time loop inside its logic.

    Q: Implement the Semi-Fixed Timestep loop from the Fix Your Timestep article by changing love.run.

    A: To implement a Semi-Fixed Timestep loop, we create a value that serves as the upperbound for what the delta time value could be.
        The logic block for this is:

        while dt > 0 do
            local current_dt = math.min(dt, upper_dt)
            if love.update then love.update(current_dt) end
            dt = dt - current_dt
        end
