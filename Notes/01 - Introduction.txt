Function Explanations:
    -love.load() is ran once at the start of the program.
    -love.update() and love.draw() are ran every frame.
    -love.graphics.newImage() loads an image texture to an assigned variable.
    -love.timer.step() measures the time taken between the last two frames.
    -love.event.pump() pushes events to the event queue.
        -The events are generated by users in some way. Key presses, window losing focus, etc.
    -love.event.poll() goes over the event queue and handles each event.
    -love.keypressed() receives as arguements the key pressed, its scancode, and if the key press event is a repeat.
    -love.graphics.origin() resets the current coordinate transformations.
    -love.graphics.clear() clears the sceen and sets it to the passed color.
    -love.graphics.present() is used to push everything drawn in love.draw to the screen


Things to Note:
    -LÖVE provides a default game loop for its projects.
        -This game loop includes functionality that clears the screen every frame before drawing new contents.
        -The default game loop can be found here - https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run
    -Default window size is 800x600
    -Individual systems like love.math are configured to be enabled or disabled inside the conf.lua file.
    -In general, in lua if a variable is not defined and it is referred to in any way, then a nil value is returned.
    -'arg' are the command line arguements passed to the LÖVE executable.
    -Variables in lua are global by default. To make one local you would initialize it with: local variableName
    -The first thing done on each frame is the processing of events.
    -love.handlers is a table of functions that calls the relevant callbacks.
    -Callbacks can be defined inside the main.lua file that will get called when an event happens.
        -Full list of callbacks are available here - https://love2d.org/wiki/love
    -In the default game loop, dt is assigned the value returned from love.timer.getDelta() and passed to love.update.
        This is done so that we can define things at rate of constant speeds, desptie frame rate changes.
